Description: Lightweight client for the RFC8555 ACMEv2 protocol
 uacme is a client for the ACMEv2 protocol described in RFC8555,
 written in plain C code with minimal dependencies (libcurl and
 GnuTLS or mbedTLS).  The ACMEv2 protocol allows a Certificate
 Authority (<https://letsencrypt.org> is a popular one) and an
 applicant to automate the process of verification and certificate
 issuance.  The protocol also provides facilities for other
 certificate management functions, such as certificate revocation.
 For more information see <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555>
