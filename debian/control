Description: Lightweight client for the RFC8555 ACMEv2 protocol
 uacme is a client for the ACMEv2 protocol described in RFC8555,
 written in plain C with minimal dependencies (libcurl and GnuTLS
 or mbedTLS).  The ACMEv2 protocol allows a Certificate Authority
 (<https://letsencrypt.org> is a popular one) and an applicant to
 automate the process of verification and certificate issuance.
 The protocol also provides facilities for other certificate
 management functions, such as certificate revocation.
 For more information see <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555>
