DESCRIPTION
-----------
*uacme* is a client for the ACMEv2 protocol described in RFC8555,
written in plain C code with minimal dependencies (libcurl and 
one of GnuTLS, OpenSSL or mbedTLS). The ACMEv2 protocol allows a
Certificate Authority (<https://letsencrypt.org> is a popular one)
and an applicant to automate the process of verification and certificate
issuance. The protocol also provides facilities for other certificate
management functions, such as certificate revocation. For more
information see <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555>


OPTIONS
-------
*-a, --acme-url*='URL'::
    ACMEv2 server directory object 'URL'. If not specified *uacme* 
    uses one of the following:
    'https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory'::: production URL
    'https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory'::: 
    staging URL (see *-s, --staging* below)

*-b, --bits*='BITS'::
    key bit length (default 2048 for RSA, 256 for EC). Only applies
    to newly generated keys. RSA key length must be a multiple of 8
    between 2048 and 8192. EC key length must be either 256
    (*NID_X9_62_prime256v1* curve) or 384 (*NID_secp384r1* curve).

*-c, --confdir*='CONFDIR'::
    Use configuration directory 'CONFDIR' (default '/etc/ssl/uacme').
    The structure is as follows (multiple 'DOMAINs' allowed)
        'CONFDIR/private/key.pem'::: ACME account private key
        'CONFDIR/private/DOMAIN/key.pem'::: certificate key for 'DOMAIN'
        'CONFDIR/DOMAIN/cert.pem'::: certificate for 'DOMAIN'

*-d, --days*='DAYS'::
    Do not reissue certificates that are still valid for longer
    than 'DAYS' (default 30).

*-f, --force*::
    Force certificate reissuance regardless of expiration date.

*-h, --hook*='PROGRAM'::
    Challenge hook program. If not specified *uacme* interacts with
    the user for every ACME challenge, printing information about the
    challenge type, token and authorization on stderr.  If specified
    *uacme* executes 'PROGRAM' (a binary, a shell script or any file that
    can be executed by the operating system) for every challenge with
    the following 5 string arguments:
        'METHOD'::: one of *begin*, *done* or *failed*.
           *begin*:::: is called at the beginning of the challenge.
           'PROGRAM' must return 0 to accept it. Any other return 
           code declines the challenge. Neither *done* nor *failed*
           method calls are made for declined challenges.
           *done*:::: is called upon successful completion of an
           accepted challenge.
           *failed*:::: is called upon failure of an accepted challenge.
        'TYPE'::: challenge type (for example *dns-01* or *http-01*)
        'IDENT'::: The identifier the challenge refers to
        'TOKEN'::: The challenge token
        'AUTH'::: The key authorization (for *dns-01* and *tls-alpn-01*
           already converted to the base64-encoded SHA256 digest format)

*-m, --must-staple*::
    Request certificates with the RFC7633 Certificate Status Request
    TLS Feature Extension, informally also known as "OCSP Must-Staple".

*-n, --never-create*::
    By default *uacme* creates directories/keys if they do not exist.
    When this option is specified *uacme* never does so and instead
    exits with an error if anything required is missing.

*-s, --staging*::
    Use Let's Encrypt staging URL for testing. This only works if
    *-a, --acme-url* is *NOT* specified.

*-t, --type*=*RSA* | *EC*::
    Key type, either RSA or EC. Only applies to newly generated keys.
    The bit length can be specified with *-b, --bits*.

*-v, --verbose*::
    By default *uacme* only produces output upon errors or when user
    interaction is required. When this option is specified *uacme*
    prints information about what is going on on stderr. This option
    can be specified more than once to increase verbosity.

*-V, --version*::
    Print program version on stderr and exit.

*-y, --yes*::
    Autoaccept ACME server terms (if any) upon new account creation.

*-?, --help*::
    Print a brief usage text on stderr and exit.


USAGE
-----

*uacme* ['OPTIONS' ...] *new* ['EMAIL']::
    Create a new ACME account with optional 'EMAIL' contact. If the
    account private key does not exist at 'CONFDIR/private/key.pem'
    a new key is generated unless *-n, --never-create* is specified.
    A valid account must be created *before* any other operation can
    succeed. Any certificate issued by the ACME server is associated
    with a single account. An account can be associated with multiple
    certificates, subject of course to the rate limits imposed by the
    ACME server.

*uacme* ['OPTIONS' ...] *update* ['EMAIL']::
    Update the 'EMAIL' associated with the ACME account corresponding to
    the account private key. If 'EMAIL' is not specified the account
    contact email is removed.

*uacme* ['OPTIONS' ...] *deactivate*::
    Deactivate the ACME account corresponding to the account private
    key. *WARNING* this action is irreversible. Users may wish to do
    this when the account key is compromised or decommissioned.
    A deactivated account can no longer request certificate issuances
    and revocations or access resources related to the account.

*uacme* ['OPTIONS' ...] *newkey*::
    Change the ACME account private key. If the new account private
    key does not exist at 'CONFDIR/private/newkey.pem' it is generated
    unless *-n, --never-create* is specified. The new key is then
    submitted to the server and if the operation succeeds the old key
    is hardlinked to 'CONFDIR/private/key-TIMESTAMP.pem' before
    renaming 'CONFDIR/private/newkey.pem' to 'CONFDIR/private/key.pem'.

*uacme* ['OPTIONS' ...] *issue* 'DOMAIN' ['ALTNAME' ...]::
    Issue a certificate for 'DOMAIN' with zero or more 'ALTNAMEs'. 
    If a certificate is already available at 'CONFDIR/DOMAIN/cert.pem'
    for the specified 'DOMAIN' and 'ALTNAMEs' and is still valid for
    longer than 'DAYS' no action is taken unless *-f, --force* is
    specified. The new certificate is saved to 'CONFDIR/DOMAIN/cert.pem'.
    If the certificate file already exists it is hardlinked to
    'CONFDIR/DOMAIN/cert-TIMESTAMP.pem' before overwriting.
    The private key for the certificate is loaded from
    'CONFDIR/private/DOMAIN/key.pem'. If no such file exists,
    a new key is generated unless *-n, --never-create* is specified.
    Wildcard DOMAINs or ALTNAMEs are dealt with correctly, as long as
    the ACME server supports them; note that any such wildcards are 
    automatically removed from the configuration subdirectory name:
    for example a certificate for '*.test.com' is saved to
    'CONFDIR/test.com/cert.pem'.

*uacme* ['OPTIONS' ...] *revoke* 'CERTFILE'::
    Revoke the certificate stored in 'CERTFILE'. Only certificates
    associated with the account can be revoked. If successful
    'CERTFILE' is renamed to 'revoked-TIMESTAMP.pem'.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
    Success

*1*::
    Certificate not reissued because it is still current

*2*::
    Failure (syntax or usage error; configuration error; 
    processing failure; unexpected error).


EXAMPLE HOOK SCRIPT
-------------------

The 'uacme.sh' hook script included in the distribution can be used
to automate the certificate issuance with 'http-01' challenges,
provided a web server for the domain being validated runs on the 
same machine, with webroot at /var/www

    #!/bin/sh
    CHALLENGE_PATH=/var/www/.well-known/acme-challenge
    ARGS=5
    E_BADARGS=85
    
    if test $# -ne "$ARGS"
    then
        echo "Usage: $(basename "$0") method type ident token auth" 1>&2
        exit $E_BADARGS
    fi
    
    METHOD=$1
    TYPE=$2
    IDENT=$3
    TOKEN=$4
    AUTH=$5
    
    case "$METHOD" in
        "begin")
            case "$TYPE" in
                http-01)
                    echo -n "${AUTH}" > "${CHALLENGE_PATH}/${TOKEN}"
                    exit $?
                    ;;
                *)
                    exit 1
                    ;;
            esac
            ;;
        "done"|"failed")
            case "$TYPE" in
                http-01)
                    rm "${CHALLENGE_PATH}/${TOKEN}"
                    exit $?
                    ;;
                *)
                    exit 1
                    ;;
            esac
            ;;
        *)
            echo "$0: invalid method" 1>&2 
            exit 1
    esac
