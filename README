README
------
This README is targeted for users of the software who build from
sources but do not necessarily develop.


COMPILATION
-----------
A typical command sequence for building uacme is shown below.
A complete list of options available for configure can be found
by running './configure --help'.

    cd uacme-<version>
    ./configure --disable-maintainer-mode
    make
    sudo make install

The software depends on libcurl and one of GnuTLS, OpenSSL or
mbedTLS

 * libcurl: the multiprotocol file transfer library 
    https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl
 * GnuTLS: for cryptographic algorithms
    https://gnutls.org
 * OpenSSL: alternative to GnuTLS
    https://www.openssl.org
 * mbedTLS: lightweight alternative to GnuTLS
    https://tls.mbed.org


DOCUMENTATION
-------------
See the documentation in the manual page included in the distribution
(uacme.1 or uacme.1.html)


LICENSING
---------
See the COPYING file for licensing information


BUGS
----
If you believe you have found a bug, please create a new issue
at https://github.com/ndilieto/uacme/issues with any applicable
information. 

Applicable information would include why the issue is a uacme bug (if
not readily apparent), output from 'uname -a', the version of uacme
being used, a stack trace if available ('bt full' if under gdb or
valgrind output), and perhaps a network trace.  Vague queries or
piecemeal messages are difficult to act upon and don't help the
development effort.


PATCHES
-------
Patches are welcome and encouraged. Patches can be submitted by 
creating a pull request at https://github.com/ndilieto/uacme/pulls

When submitting patches, please be sure to use sources from the git
repository, and preferrably from the master branch.  To create a patch
for the project from a local git repository, please use the following
commands. 'uacme' should be the local directory of a previous git clone.

    cd uacme
    git add the-file-you-modified.c another-file.c
    git commit the-file-you-modified.c another-file.c
