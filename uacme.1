.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBuacme\fR is a client for the ACMEv2 protocol described in RFC8555, written in plain C code with minimal dependencies (libcurl and one of GnuTLS, OpenSSL or mbedTLS)\&. The ACMEv2 protocol allows a Certificate Authority (https://letsencrypt\&.org is a popular one) and an applicant to automate the process of verification and certificate issuance\&. The protocol also provides facilities for other certificate management functions, such as certificate revocation\&. For more information see https://tools\&.ietf\&.org/html/rfc8555
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-a, \-\-acme\-url\fR=\fIURL\fR
.RS 4
ACMEv2 server directory object
\fIURL\fR\&. If not specified
\fBuacme\fR
uses one of the following:

.RE
.PP
\fB\-b, \-\-bits\fR=\fIBITS\fR

curve) or 384 (\fBNID_secp384r1\fR
curve)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-c, \-\-confdir\fR=\fICONFDIR\fR
.RS 4

\fIIDENTIFIERs\fR
allowed)
.PP
\fICONFDIR/private/key\&.pem\fR
.RS 4
ACME account private key
.RE
.PP
\fICONFDIR/private/IDENTIFIER/key\&.pem\fR
.RS 4
certificate key for
\fIIDENTIFIER\fR
.RE
.PP
\fICONFDIR/IDENTIFIER/cert\&.pem\fR
.RS 4

\fIIDENTIFIER\fR
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d, \-\-days\fR=\fIDAYS\fR

\fB\-o, \-\-no\-ocsp\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f, \-\-force\fR
.RS 4
Force certificate reissuance regardless of expiration date\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h, \-\-hook\fR=\fIPROGRAM\fR
.RS 4
Challenge hook program\&. If not specified
\fBuacme\fR
interacts with the user for every ACME challenge, printing information about the challenge type, token and authorization on stderr\&. If specified
\fBuacme\fR
executes
\fIPROGRAM\fR
(a binary, a shell script or any file that can be executed by the operating system) for every challenge with the following 5 string arguments:
.PP
\fIMETHOD\fR
.RS 4
one of
\fBbegin\fR,
\fBdone\fR
or
\fBfailed\fR\&.
.PP
\fBbegin\fR
.RS 4
is called at the beginning of the challenge\&.
\fIPROGRAM\fR
must return 0 to accept it\&. Any other return code declines the challenge\&. Neither
\fBdone\fR
nor
\fBfailed\fR
method calls are made for declined challenges\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdone\fR
.RS 4
is called upon successful completion of an accepted challenge\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBfailed\fR
.RS 4
is called upon failure of an accepted challenge\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fITYPE\fR

\fBdns\-01\fR
and
\fBtls\-alpn\-01\fR
already converted to the base64\-encoded SHA256 digest format)
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-m, \-\-must\-staple\fR
.RS 4
Request certificates with the RFC7633 Certificate Status Request TLS Feature Extension, informally also known as "OCSP Must\-Staple"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-n, \-\-never\-create\fR
.RS 4
By default
\fBuacme\fR
creates directories/keys if they do not exist\&. When this option is specified
\fBuacme\fR
never does so and instead exits with an error if anything required is missing\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-o, \-\-no\-ocsp\fR
.RS 4
When this flag is
\fBnot\fR
specified and the certificate has an Authority Information Access extension with an OCSP server location according to
https://tools\&.ietf\&.org/html/rfc5280#section\-4\&.2\&.2\&.1
\fBuacme\fR
makes an OCSP request to the server; if the certificate is reported as revoked
\fBuacme\fR
forces reissuance regardless of the expiration date\&. See also
\fB\-d, \-\-days\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s, \-\-staging\fR
.RS 4
Use Let\(cqs Encrypt staging URL for testing\&. This only works if
\fB\-a, \-\-acme\-url\fR
is
\fBNOT\fR
specified\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t, \-\-type\fR=\fBRSA\fR | \fBEC\fR
.RS 4
Key type, either RSA or EC\&. Only applies to newly generated keys\&. The bit length can be specified with
\fB\-b, \-\-bits\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
By default
\fBuacme\fR
only produces output upon errors or when user interaction is required\&. When this option is specified
\fBuacme\fR
prints information about what is going on on stderr\&. This option can be specified more than once to increase verbosity\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-V, \-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Print program version on stderr and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-y, \-\-yes\fR
.RS 4
Autoaccept ACME server terms (if any) upon new account creation\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-?, \-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Print a brief usage text on stderr and exit\&.
.RE
.SH "USAGE"
.PP
\fBuacme\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR \&...] \fBnew\fR [\fIEMAIL\fR]
.RS 4
Create a new ACME account with optional
\fIEMAIL\fR
contact\&. If the account private key does not exist at
\fICONFDIR/private/key\&.pem\fR
a new key is generated unless
\fB\-n, \-\-never\-create\fR
is specified\&. A valid account must be created
\fBbefore\fR
any other operation can succeed\&. Any certificate issued by the ACME server is associated with a single account\&. An account can be associated with multiple certificates, subject of course to the rate limits imposed by the ACME server\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBuacme\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR \&...] \fBupdate\fR [\fIEMAIL\fR]
.RS 4
Update the
\fIEMAIL\fR
associated with the ACME account corresponding to the account private key\&. If
\fIEMAIL\fR
is not specified the account contact email is removed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBuacme\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR \&...] \fBdeactivate\fR
.RS 4
Deactivate the ACME account corresponding to the account private key\&.
\fBWARNING\fR
this action is irreversible\&. Users may wish to do this when the account key is compromised or decommissioned\&. A deactivated account can no longer request certificate issuances and revocations or access resources related to the account\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBuacme\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR \&...] \fBnewkey\fR
.RS 4
Change the ACME account private key\&. If the new account private key does not exist at
\fICONFDIR/private/newkey\&.pem\fR
it is generated unless
\fB\-n, \-\-never\-create\fR
is specified\&. The new key is then submitted to the server and if the operation succeeds the old key is hardlinked to
\fICONFDIR/private/key\-TIMESTAMP\&.pem\fR
before renaming
\fICONFDIR/private/newkey\&.pem\fR
to
\fICONFDIR/private/key\&.pem\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBuacme\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR \&...] \fBissue\fR \fIIDENTIFIER\fR [\fIALTNAME\fR \&...]
.RS 4
Issue a certificate for
\fIIDENTIFIER\fR
with zero or more
\fIALTNAMEs\fR\&. If a certificate is already available at
\fICONFDIR/IDENTIFIER/cert\&.pem\fR
for the specified
\fIIDENTIFIER\fR
and
\fIALTNAMEs\fR
and is still valid for longer than
\fIDAYS\fR
no action is taken unless
\fB\-f, \-\-force\fR
is specified or
\fB\-o, \-\-no\-ocsp\fR
is
\fBnot\fR
specified and the certificate is reported as revoked by the OCSP server\&. The new certificate is saved to
\fICONFDIR/IDENTIFIER/cert\&.pem\fR\&. If the certificate file already exists it is hardlinked to
\fICONFDIR/IDENTIFIER/cert\-TIMESTAMP\&.pem\fR
before overwriting\&. The private key for the certificate is loaded from
\fICONFDIR/private/IDENTIFIER/key\&.pem\fR\&. If no such file exists, a new key is generated unless
\fB\-n, \-\-never\-create\fR
is specified\&. Wildcard IDENTIFIERs or ALTNAMEs are dealt with correctly, as long as the ACME server supports them; note that any such wildcards are automatically removed from the configuration subdirectory name: for example a certificate for
\fI*\&.test\&.com\fR
is saved to
\fICONFDIR/test\&.com/cert\&.pem\fR\&. IP address IDENTIFIERs and ALTNAMEs are also supported according to
https://tools\&.ietf\&.org/html/rfc8738#section\-3
.RE
.PP
\fBuacme\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR \&...] \fBsignonly\fR \fICSR\fR
.RS 4
Issue a certificate for the certificate signing request stored in
\fICSR\fR\&. If successful the certificate will be stored in
\fICSR\&.cert\&.pem\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBuacme\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR \&...] \fBrevoke\fR \fICERTFILE\fR
.RS 4
Revoke the certificate stored in
\fICERTFILE\fR\&. Only certificates associated with the account can be revoked\&. If successful
\fICERTFILE\fR
is renamed to
\fIrevoked\-TIMESTAMP\&.pem\fR\&.
.RE
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.PP
\fB0\fR
.RS 4
Success
.RE
.PP
\fB1\fR
.RS 4
Certificate not reissued because it is still current
.RE
.PP
\fB2\fR
.RS 4
Failure (syntax or usage error; configuration error; processing failure; unexpected error)\&.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLE HOOK SCRIPT"
.sp
The \fIuacme\&.sh\fR hook script included in the distribution can be used to automate the certificate issuance with \fIhttp\-01\fR challenges, provided a web server for the domain being validated runs on the same machine, with webroot at /var/www
